====================IMPORTANT====================

**Remember to Burn the first token if this is released to Mainnet**
This is due to the Smart Contract Function "getTokenId" returns 0 when no token exists due to uints.

====================TO DO====================
[] Commenting Functionality
[X] Fix Likes
[] Follow / Unfollow
[] Fix Soulbound Check Token ID --> It shows URI (easy fix) -- Add a must contain "ipfs://"

    - Maybe just ctrl+F the posts or look up users who have posts
[X] Fix Delete Button for Owners Posts

[X] Make sure the photo button will allow you to add a post along with text inside of the text area or in a modal
[X] Firebase will need an ID to Map to the tweets being stored, Map TokenId to Post ID? {TokenId!}
[X] set up firebase to connect to Posts and Images --Blockchain storage too expensive for mainnet

====================DESIGN====================

====================IMPORTANT====================

**Remember to Burn the first token if this is released to Mainnet**
This is due to the Smart Contract Function "getTokenId" returns 0 when no token exists due to uints.

====================TO DO====================
[] Fix Delete Button for Owners Posts 
[] Set Loading UI Effect while post is loading
[] Fix Soulbound Check Token ID --> It shows URI (easy fix)
[X] See if we can get images on Posts
[] Follow / Unfollow
[] Fix Sticky Footer blocking posts
[] Fix Likes
[] Commenting Functionality
[X] Show Posts by Pulling in from FB
[X] Prevent Default on Submitting Post
[X] Confirm how images should be saved in firebase *Storage*
[X] Need a unique ID for photo uploads *Timestamp*
[] Added loggedIn state for showing online for future state
[X] Make sure the photo button will allow you to add a post along with text inside of the text area or in a modal
[X] Firebase will need an ID to Map to the tweets being stored, Map TokenId to Post ID? {TokenId!}
[X] set up firebase to connect to Posts and Images --Blockchain storage too expensive for mainnet
[] Search Button Needs to have some functionality in Widgets.tsx
    - Maybe just ctrl+F the posts or look up users who have posts
[X] Timestamps will be handled by Firebase? *Yes*

====================DESIGN====================

[] Work on Mobile Responsiveness - Ipad, Phone, Smaller Phone

====================NICE TO HAVES====================

[] Figure out to make only the middle column scroll

    - or something different
[] Make an animation where 003 shifts to full logo upon refresh

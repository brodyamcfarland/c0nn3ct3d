====================IMPORTANT====================

**Remember to Burn the first token if this is released to Mainnet**
This is due to the Smart Contract Function "getTokenId" returns 0 when no token exists due to uints.

====================TO DO====================
[X] Prevent Default on Submitting Post
[X] Confirm how images should be saved in firebase (Storage!)
[] Added loggedIn state for showing online for future state
[X] Make sure the photo button will allow you to add a post along with text inside of the text area or in a modal
[X] Firebase will need an ID to Map to the tweets being stored, Map TokenId to Post ID? {TokenId!}
[] set up firebase to connect to Posts and Images --Blockchain storage too expensive for mainnet
[] Search Button Needs to have some functionality in Widgets.tsx
    - Maybe just ctrl+F the posts or look up users who have posts (we'll see)
[X] Timestamps will be handled by Firebase? {YES}

====================DESIGN====================

[] Work on Mobile Responsiveness - Ipad, Phone, Smaller Phone

====================NICE TO HAVES====================

[] Figure out to make only the middle column scroll
[] Daily Sentiment up or down button
    - can click 1x per day
    - avg % starts at 50%
    - each person moves 2% since its a small app
    - or something different
[] Make an animation where 003 shifts to full logo upon refresh

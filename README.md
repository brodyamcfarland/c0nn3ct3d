======================TO DO==========================
- Added loggedIn state for showing online for future state
0) NEED TO HAVE ERROR HANDLING WHEN SOMEBODY DOES NOT HAVE THE TOKEN!
1) Make it so while the Profile pic is loading, it shows an Icon or Loading... in small letters
2) Make sure the photo button will allow you to add a post along with text inside of the text area or in a modal
3) set up firebase to connect to Posts and Images --Blockchain storage too expensive for mainnet
4) Firebase will need an ID to Map to the tweets being stored, Map TokenId to Post ID?
5) Search Button Needs to have some functionality in Widgets.tsx
    - Maybe just ctrl+F the posts or look up users who have posts (we'll see)
6) Timestamps will be handled by Firebase?

===================DESIGN============================
1) Work on Mobile Responsiveness - Ipad, Phone, Smaller Phone
===================NICE TO HAVES=====================
- Figure out to make only the middle column scroll
- Daily Sentiment up or down button
    - can click 1x per day
    - avg % starts at 50%
    - each person moves 2% since its a small app
    - or something different
- Make an animation where 003 shifts to full logo upon refresh
